Set theory-
http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html
proper subset represented by C excludes itself
proper subset of P are {2,3,5}, {2}, {2,3,5,7,11}, {} etc, but not {2,3,5,7,11,13} which is P itself

power set denoted by P or IP the number of elements in a powerset is 2^n where n is the number of elements in that set

intersection-
looks like a n
this means overlap
F n P = {2,3} = {prime factors of 24}

Union -
looks like an u
uniting the members of 2 or more sets
F u P = Either in F or P or both

Cartesian product of two sets A and B written as A x B and is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a E B and b E B

relations and functions

a binary relation links a member of a set A with a set B by some defined rule. We often use ordered 2-tuples to denote these.

E.g.: if a E A and b E B and a is related to b by a relation R, then we can represent it by (a,b) E R or aRb. note R is a subset of A x B 

x -> 4x + 3
one to one relation

x -> x squared
many to one
(because -3 and 3 are both 9)

x -> square root
one to many

composite functions

Proofs
if p then q
means if P is assumed to be true then we can prove Q is true
n is even => n = 2k

Proof by contraposition
Claim: For all integers n if n^2 is even then n is even.
proof: We use the method of proof by contraposition. The contrapositive is "if n is odd, then n^2 is odd"
Let n be an arbitray odd integer, then n = 2k+1 for some integer k.
Now n squared = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k)+1
since 2k^2 + 2k is an integer under the closure of integer operations n*2 is odd
P -> ! = Not Q -> Not P

Proof by contradiction
http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_logic-proofs.html
Ex: prove there are no integers x and y such that x^2 = 4y + 2
suppose there are integers x and y such that x^2 = 4y + 2 = 2(2y+1)
so x^2 is even and we see in previous proofs that x is even. Therefore x = 2k for some integer k and x^2 = 4k^2

This gives us 4k^2 = 2(2y+1)
2k^2 = 2y + 1
however 2k^2 is even and 2y+1 is odd so we have a contradiction. 

Proof by induction

null [] checks if a list is empty or not
null [] returns true
null [1,2] returns false

reverse x takes in a list and reverses it

++ adds a list to a list (appends)

1:[1,2,3]
returns [1,1,2,3]

a tuple is a fixed length sequence of data values where the components of the tuple can have different types

prelude functions are built in

[10,9..0]
returns numbers from 10 to 0

[10,8..0]
returns even numbers from 10 to 0

['a'..'p']
returns abcdefghijklmnop

[0..]
infinite list of all positive integers

Creating a data type

data Colour = White | Black | Grey
data Shape = Disc | Triangle
data Size = Big | Small

colour :: Thing -> Colour
colour R = Grey
...
shape :: Thing -> Shape
shape R = Disc
...
size :: Thing -> Size
size R 

isWhite, isTriangle [sequent symbnol] isSmall
saying that every white triangle is small
or everything that is white and a triangle, is also small


isWhite  [sequent symbnol]  Â¬ isBlack
everything that iswhite is not black

when sequents are in a fraction its a sound rule
if all statements above the line are true, the statement below is true aswell
above is called the premises below is the conclusion

a double bar is called equivalence
