Homogeneous equations - 
when all constant terms are zero
eg a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn = 0
if all x terms are 0 then it is clearly a solution - this is called a trivial solution
any solution where at least one variable has a nonzero value is called a nontrivial solution.


If a homogeneous system of linear equations has more variables than equations, then it has a
nontrivial solution (in fact, infinitely many).




Matrix - 
A matrix is said to be in row-echelon form (and will be called a row-echelon matrix) if it
satisfies the following three conditions:
1. All zero rows (consisting entirely of zeros) are at the bottom.
2. The first nonzero entry from the left in each nonzero row is a 1, called the leading 1 for that
row.
3. Each leading 1 is to the right of all leading 1s in the rows above it.
A row-echelon matrix is said to be in reduced row-echelon form (and will be called a reduced
row-echelon matrix) if, in addition, it satisfies the following condition:
4. Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.

Gaussian algorithm

Step 1. If the matrix consists entirely of zeros, stop—it is already in row-echelon form.
Step 2. Otherwise, find the first column from the left containing a nonzero entry (call it a),
and move the row containing that entry to the top position.
Step 3. Now multiply the new top row by 1/a to create a leading 1.
Step 4. By subtracting multiples of that row from rows below it, make each entry below the
leading 1 zero.
This completes the first row, and all further row operations are carried out on the remaining rows.
Step 5. Repeat steps 1–4 on the matrix consisting of the remaining rows.
The process stops when either no rows remain at step 5 or the remaining rows consist entirely of
zeros.

r (or rank) is the number of rows with leading 1s

if there is no leading variable for a variable set it to like t or smth x3 = t for a parameter

Gaussian Elimination
To solve a system of linear equations proceed as follows:
1. Carry the augmented matrix to a reduced row-echelon matrix using elementary row
operations.
2. If a row

0 0 0 ··· 0 1
occurs, the system is inconsistent.
3. Otherwise, assign the nonleading variables (if any) as parameters, and use the equations
corresponding to the reduced row-echelon matrix to solve for the leading variables in terms
of the parameters.
